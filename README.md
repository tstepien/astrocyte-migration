The code contained in the astrocyte-migration project was developed to numerically simulate astrocyte migration and differentiation during embryonic development of the retina. It is described in:
>[Tracy L. Stepien](https://github.com/tstepien/) and [Timothy W. Secomb](https://physiology.arizona.edu/people/secomb), Spreading mechanics and differentiation of astrocytes
during retinal development, Accepted in *Journal of Theoretical Biology*, DOI: [10.1016/j.jtbi.2022.111208](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2022.111208).
